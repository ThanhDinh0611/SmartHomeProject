## Introduction
A self-study project of a second-year student which have won the first place in DNTU Student Conference 2020. In this project, we will simply write some code to connect to Blynk server on the micro controller to update data from sensors, receive signals from server to control devices.\

I have also included a link to the documentation and video to demonstrate step by step how we can configure the micro controller, sensors and devices as well as initialize the Blynk server and application on a smart phone.
